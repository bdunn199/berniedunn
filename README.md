git init
```
# Creating the next version

First view the status to see where things are at

```bash
git status
```

Add the changes you want in the next version (the `-p` option asks you 
change by change and is not required to just add everything)

```bash
git add -p $file
```

If you want to remove a file

```bash
git rm $file
```

# Save the next version

To save the next version run

```bash
git commit
```

For a log message, describe why you made the change, not what change you 
made as the computer can tell you the latter but not the former. Make 
the first line a brief oneline overview.

# Viewing changes

`--graph` options draws a pretty graph and `--oneline` just displays the 
first line of each message)

```bash
git log
```

file to just see the changes in that file)

```bash
git diff
 ```

You can view the changes that aren't staged yet 
with (you can specify a file to just see the changes in that file)

```bash
git diff
```

You can view how the next version (the staged version) differs from the 
previous version with

```bash
git diff --staged
```
View changes between Folder/Working tree and master

```bash
git diff master

View changes between two commits (see following section for overview on specifying commits)

```bash
git diff 3b12245 def106f
```

# Specifying commits

Commits can be specified by

* number: `def106f`
* branch name: `master`
* going back n steps: `master~$n` (replace `$n` with the number)
* taking the nth branch: `master^$n`  (replace `$n` with the number)
